<h3>Plant Disease Detection</h3>
<small><i>This Project is build under the course CSE465</i></small>
<p>Pattern recognition can be used in many aspects of agriculture, one of which is Plant disease detection. Image and pattern recognition techniques are applied to a dataset of images of a large variety of plants to train them to identify if a plant is diseased and if it is, to specify its disease.</p>
